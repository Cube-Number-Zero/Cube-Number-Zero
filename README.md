An arcade puzzle game about connecting flowers to each other with vines. The player must keep all flowers of the same color connected at all times, and must use portals to connect flowers across different boards.

_Kruskal's Garden_ was created in 72 hours for the SSU Computing Houses Fall Game Jam 2025 with the theme **Connections**. It was created by: [myself](https://cube-number-zero.itch.io/) (gameplay programming, dark magic), [Emma Brandt](https://emmagain.itch.io/) (UI programming and layout), [Kenyon Fears](https://drfear.itch.io/) (art, some UI programming), [Chloe Shaffer](https://goatz4eva.itch.io/) (art), and [Kory Byrne](https://koryb.itch.io/) (music).

Programming, level design, and game design were done by [me](https://cube-number-zero.itch.io/); the art was created by [Chloe Shaffer](https://goatz4eva.itch.io/), and the music by [Kory Byrne](https://koryb.itch.io/).
