A puzzle-platformer about Mothman trying to get to his lamp by using a small portal to another dimension. The player must use the portal to cut away to an alternate level, allowing the player to progress by switching between the two level sides.

_The Light, The Cryptid, and The Wormhole_ was created in 48 hours for the SSU Fall Game Jam 2025 with the theme **Window**. Programming, level design, and game design were done by me; the art was created by [Chloe Shaffer](https://goatz4eva.itch.io/), and the music by [Kory Byrne](https://koryb.itch.io/).

Winner of the **Jammer's Choice** and **Best Use of Theme** awards.

An experimental puzzle game where the player has to navigate levels without seeing where they are; they must keep track of all puzzle elements in their memory while trying to find the solution.
