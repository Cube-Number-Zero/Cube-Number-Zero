# Projects
## [Kruskal's Garden](https://code-witch.itch.io/kruskals-garden)

[<img width="315" height="250" alt="kruskal" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81315731-aa86-45c0-8163-e3a07e6bb2c2" />](https://code-witch.itch.io/kruskals-garden)

An arcade puzzle game about connecting flowers to each other with vines. The player must keep all flowers of the same color connected at all times, and must use portals to connect flowers across different boards.

_Kruskal's Garden_ was created in 72 hours for the SSU Computing Houses Fall Game Jam 2025 with the theme **Connections**. It was created by: [myself](https://code-witch.itch.io/) (gameplay programming, [dark magic](#dark-magic-kruskals-garden)), [Emma Brandt](https://emmagain.itch.io/) (UI programming and layout), [Kenyon Fears](https://drfear.itch.io/) (art, some UI programming), [Chloe Shaffer](https://goatz4eva.itch.io/) (art), and [Kory Byrne](https://koryb.itch.io/) (music).

_Kruskal's Garden_ was a very fun project to work on. The concept (growing vines to connect flowers, with different boards and portals between them) seemed like it would be very easy to implement, but that turned out not to be the case. It had probably the most complicated programming tasks I had ever worked on at that point (with the possible exceptiong of simulating tire slip and grip in _Pizza Wizard: 144X_), and for a significant portion of the game jam, I thought I wouldn't be able to finish it in time. Eventually, though, I was able to finish the drawing and connecting logic, and was even able to polish and balance the game with the rest of my team. The only feature that had to be cut for time was crossing vines over each other, which I completed the next weekend and added in an update.

## [TROJAN](https://code-witch.itch.io/trojan)

[<img width="315" height="98" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd479d0f-d2db-490b-9f60-bab982591017"/>](https://code-witch.itch.io/trojan)

A top-down strategy game about disguising yourself as the enemy to defeat them from within, in a competitive-shooter-inspired game mode about capturing control points.

_TROJAN_ was created in 48 hours for the [Global Game Jam 2026](https://globalgamejam.org/games/2026/trojan-2) with the theme **Mask**. It was created by: [myself](https://code-witch.itch.io/) (gameplay programming, enemy AI), [Kenyon Fears](https://drfear.itch.io/) (art, shader programming), [Chloe Shaffer](https://goatz4eva.itch.io/) (art), and [Kory Byrne](https://koryb.itch.io/) (music).

_TROJAN_ was my first experience of fully completing a non-puzzle game, and allowed me to work with aspects that often aren't included or are less prominent in puzzle games, like enemy AI and gameplay balancing.

## [The Light, The Cryptid, and The Wormhole](https://code-witch.itch.io/the-light-the-cryptid-and-the-wormhole)

[<img width="315" height="250" alt="yI4foT" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/278735f5-52e7-44dc-88a8-73384be21c3e" />](https://code-witch.itch.io/the-light-the-cryptid-and-the-wormhole)

A puzzle-platformer about Mothman trying to get to his lamp by using a small portal to another dimension. The player must use the portal to cut away to an alternate level, allowing the player to progress by switching between the two level sides.

_The Light, The Cryptid, and The Wormhole_ was created in 48 hours for the SSU Fall Game Jam 2025 with the theme **Window**. Programming, level design, and game design were done by [me](https://code-witch.itch.io/); the art was created by [Chloe Shaffer](https://goatz4eva.itch.io/), and the music by [Kory Byrne](https://koryb.itch.io/).

## [Black Box](https://code-witch.itch.io/black-box)
[<img width="315" height="286" alt="UhdCiO" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6ac54b0-1205-436c-a5fa-6d6b2152da2f" />](https://code-witch.itch.io/black-box)

An experimental puzzle game where the player has to navigate levels without seeing where they are; they must keep track of all puzzle elements in their memory while trying to find the solution.

_Black Box_ was created in seven days for the SSU Gaming Houses Fall Game Jam 2023 with the theme **Trust**. _Black Box_ was a solo project—all programming, game design, music, level editor design, and art were created by me.

_Black Box_ was the first project I actually released, and I'm still surprised by how much of an impact it made. It was the first game jam I had ever worked on solo, so I had no real prior experience to tell if I was doing well until after the game jam had ended.

## [Robovac Software Engineer Simulator 2535](https://code-witch.itch.io/robovac-software-engineer-simulator-2535)
[<img width="315" height="177" alt="DKE4zb" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03321a79-f565-4ff0-829b-68ae139ff9fd" />](https://code-witch.itch.io/robovac-software-engineer-simulator-2535)

A Zachlike programming puzzle game about programming a vacuum cleaner efficiently with a low-level programming language inspired by assembly code.

_Robovac Software Engineer Simulator 2535_ was created in nine days for the SSU Spring Game Jam 2024 with the theme **Trash**. It was a solo project—all programming, art, game design, and the language reference manual were created by me.

_Robovac Software Engineer Simulator 2535_ was a game that I wanted to play. Many of my favorite video games have been Zachtronics' hardcore assembly language programming games like _TIS-100_ and _EXAPUNKS_, and I wanted to try to create a game like that. The game is very short due to being a game jam, but I still want to one day return to it and turn it into a full game.

## [Pizza Wizard: 144X](https://code-witch.itch.io/pizza-wizard-144x)
[<img width="315" height="250" alt="tsPHqb" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdf30e83-e083-4242-8dbb-757cb97c3ce2" />](https://code-witch.itch.io/pizza-wizard-144x)

An action game about delivering pizzas and using magic spells to do it.

_Pizza Wizard: 144X_ was created for a class project by Dante Brooks, [Camilla Leslie](https://thecammy.itch.io/), [myself](https://code-witch.itch.io/), and Yvette Smith. My responsibilies were creating the music and programming the player controller, realistic car physics, the upgrade system, and several small systems for the others to use.

_Pizza Wizard: 144X_ was my first experience working with a large (more than two people) team. It also was my first chance to try realistically simulating something from real life in a game. I had to spend many hours researching tire physics and Pacejka's magic formula to get it just how I wanted, but I'm very happy with the results.

# Code Snippets
## Dark Magic (_Kruskal's Garden_)
<img width="315" height="105" alt="dark magic" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac25f28a-f444-4a1d-893e-e081ee6f8e93" />

`#region dark magic` was a 410-line-long region of code in a .gd file from my game jam project _Kruskal's Garden_ that was seperated from the main file because of its complexity. It was entirely written by me to process drawing vines and detecting disconnected flowers.

Here is an abridged sample of code from `#region dark magic` (board.gd):
```gdscript
var atlasindex: int = VECTOR_TO_ATLAS_INDEX[cell - drawing_cell]

# Set previous cell's atlas
if ATLAS_COORDS_TO_ATLAS_INDEX.has(previous_atlas_coords):
  # Update previous cell
  var previous_atlas_index = ATLAS_COORDS_TO_ATLAS_INDEX[previous_atlas_coords]
  var new_atlas_index = previous_atlas_index ^ atlasindex
  if ATLAS_INDEX_TO_ATLAS_COORDS.has(new_atlas_index):
    var new_atlas_coords = ATLAS_INDEX_TO_ATLAS_COORDS[new_atlas_index]
    layer.set_cell(drawing_cell, 0, new_atlas_coords + ATLAS_OFFSETS[drawing_type])
```
This code handles updating a cell's tile atlas when you draw a vine from that cell to an adjacent cell.

Determining the best way to do this was probably the most difficult part of the project that I worked on. The problem is that I didn't have an easy way to determine the shape of the vine on a cell. I could read its tile atlas coordinates using `TileMapLayer.get_cell_atlas_coords(coords: Vector2i)` to get the coordinates of the tile's sprite in its spritesheet, but while this was unique to each sprite, their specific coordinates were mostly arbitrary. I needed a way to convert the tiles' shape into data.

Eventually, I realized that I could express a tile's shape using the bits of an integer. If a cell had a vine connecting to its upper edge, it would have a 1 in the ones place. If it had a vine connecting to the right, it would have a 1 in the twos place. Downward vines meant a 1 in the fours place, and leftward vines meant a 1 in the eights place. If a cell was connected to the left and top (┘), it would be represented as 0b1001 (9). I called the integers structured this way atlas indices. I created a dictionary to convert tile atlas coordinates to an integer like this (`ATLAS_COORDS_TO_ATLAS_INDEX`) and another to do the inverse (`ATLAS_INDEX_TO_ATLAS_COORDS`).

Now for the code itself:
First, I get a vector representing the direction the player is drawing towards and use another dictionary to convert it into an atlas index corresponding to a vine growing from that direction. Then, I determine the atlas index of the cell that is already in this square. Once I have the current atlas index of the cell and the atlas index that I want to add, I can bitwise exclusive or (`^`) the two together to get the resulting atlas index. Then, I can convert the atlas index back into atlas coordinates and use `TileMapLayer.set_cell(coords: Vector2i, source_id: int, atlas_coords: Vector2i)` to set the cell to the correct sprite.

After the game jam was completed, I returned to _Kruskal's Garden_ to add a few more features and clean up the code over the following weekend. As of today, `#region dark magic` stands at exactly 499 lines.
